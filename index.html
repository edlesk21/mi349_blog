        <h3> Fridays with E.J.</h3>
        <p> E.J. Leskauskas - October 27, 2023</p>
        <p> Today is Friday, so we had to hit up the bins at the MSU surplus store to see if they had any good finds to thrift. After I woke up, showered, ate breakfast (I had a breakfast burrito :), and checked my schedule, it was time to meet up with my friends. I got in my car and drove down the street to pick up my friends Summer and Alyvia! Every Friday, the MSU surplus store puts out clothing bins for you to pick through, and you can fill up an entire bag with clothes, and it is not too expensive. </p>

        <p>When we got to the surplus store, we went to the back area to find the clothing bins and started sorting through them. It was a very tough task! We spent around an hour sorting through the clothing to see if we could find anything that would fit us or go well with our Halloween costumes! At the end of the hour, I did not find too much. I found two shirts, and that was it! I know, a big bust! But I couldn't leave the store with just nothing! I went over to the clothing racks to see if there were any shirts or pants that I would wear. I ended up finding a designer long-sleeved shirt. STEAL! I had a great time shopping with my friends. </p>

        <h3> Michigan State for the Win! </h3>
        <p> E.J. Leskauskas - October 25, 2023</p>
        <p> What's up, everybody? Today was the big day! Michigan State had their first exhibition basketball game of the season. They played Hillsdale College, a small division two school, and were not ready for the new Michigan State Basketball team. We brought in a bunch of recruits and boy, were they good! The energy was in the air, the players were excited, it was great!

        <p> I went to the game with some of my friends with lower bowl tickets, and we all sat together in some great seats. Of course, the returning guard Tyson Walker had himself a game! He scored 13 points! Some of the new MSU players also did some really cool dunks! At the end of the game, the Spartans walked away with a huge victory, winning 85 to 43. I have so much fun at the game and am glad basketball season is coming up! We play again on Sunday in another exhibition game against Tenessee, and it should be a great game! Both of the teams are in the top ten in the country right now! Hopefully, MSU basketball can have a way better season than the football team. In my final semester at Michigan State, I hope our team can win the national championship! </p>
